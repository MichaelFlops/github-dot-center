## Welcome to the Center of Github!

Annndddd what's at the center? A beat maker. I make beats. I make them for all humans using github.



```console
$ DISCLAIMER I am not affiliated with github... yet
  Maybe if they like my beats then I can quit my day job being a terrible web dev
  and make beats all day for them.
```

I have a romantic thought. I imagine at the very center of the Github offices in SF, there's a room deep inside where someone makes beats all day. They make beats for the people working hard writing good code, debugging shitty code, or thinking about writing code.

These tunes are designed for the people who really matter in this world, just about as much as everyone else on this little blue dot. Being a programmer myself I know well the heavy toll of a long work day chasing bugs or trying to read the minds of other engineers.

```console
  $ Please $ my music so I can make music for you all day n nite. I don't want to be a bad programmer anymore. I've been trying to program for six years now, and I barely got this hugo site running.

  Support ^here^ 

```
